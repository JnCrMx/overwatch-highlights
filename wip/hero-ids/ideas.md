# Hero IDs

Some of the IDs look quite fine (e.g. the last 4 IDs),
but some are swapped or completely messed up (like the first few ones).

Maybe (just *maybe*) those IDs represent the order Blizzard started working at them.
That seems possible, because heros released together are still in group and
it would actually make no sense to assign lower IDs to later heros.

**But** that still doesn't explain missing numbers (like hero #1).
The huge gaps seem quite normal to separate "blocks", but tiny gaps are weird.

If anyone has any idea about a structure behind the ideas, please tell me :)
